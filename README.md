# Beware of the Simulated DAG! Causal Discovery Benchmarks May Be Easy To Game

**[Update 09/2023]** Our new library [CausalDisco](https://causaldisco.github.io/CausalDisco/) provides the baseline algorithms and analytics tools presented here, as well as a [new scale-invariant version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18211) in a single python package for causal discovery benchmarking.

This repository contains stand-alone implementations of **varsortability**, **sortnregress**, and **chain-orientation** as presented in

For a **basic experimental set-up for the comparison of causal structure learning algorithms** as shown in the same work, see the [VarsortabilityExperimentSuite](https://github.com/Scriddie/VarsortabilityExperimentSuite) repository.

To run, perform the following actions **within the /src directory**:

1. Install dependencies by running `./install.sh` in this directory.
2. For **varsortability** run `source env/bin/activate; python varsortability.py` in the current directory.
2. For **sortnregress**, run `source env/bin/activate; python sortnregress.py` in the current directory.
2. For **chain-orientation**
    - run `source env/bin/activate; python chain_orientation.py` in the current directory (may take some time).
    - run `source env/bin/activate; python chain_orientation_three_vars_symbolic.py` in the current directory (may take some time).
